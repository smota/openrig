// S10 (OPR.0.5.5.10) — the gateway as an IN-DAEMON SUBSYSTEM. M1 §3 as amended 2026-08-26
// (desk head-amendment under founder R2): the gateway runs in-process at daemon boot — the
// shipped components (GatewayDispatcher + DispatchBuffer) reused verbatim, NO child process,
// NO gateway↔connector socket wire. spawn-gateway.ts / gateway-process*.ts / transport.ts are
// the retired process-split shape and must not gain callers (second-deployable ABSENCE is a
// proof-contract red).
//
// Durability is the shipped contract, unchanged by the re-homing: a decision is persisted to
// the durable buffer BEFORE delivery is attempted (dispatcher enqueues first), drained ONLY
// after the delivery layer reports success (the in-process ack), and un-Acked decisions replay
// on every subsystem (re)start — a delivery failure is retained, never dropped.
//
// Failure honesty (mini-req 1): a wiring failure at start() surfaces as state=failed with the
// cause named, visible on the health surface — it never throws into daemon boot (a broken
// gateway must not take the daemon down) and never reads as silently active.
