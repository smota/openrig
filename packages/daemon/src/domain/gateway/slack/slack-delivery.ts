// S10 — the subsystem's Slack DELIVERY path (successor to the retired connector-server's
// slackDeliverFn; the proof-1 semantics carry over unchanged): render the OutboundDecision to a
// hygienic payload (slice-11 item 7 redaction + Block Kit via message.ts) and post it. A 2xx →
// ok (the in-process ack drains the durable buffer); any failure → a bounded failure class (the
// wire retains + replays — fail-visible, never a silent drop).
//
// Changes from the retired path, each contract-driven:
//   - postWebhook → postChatMessage: the R2 thread shape needs thread_ts, which a webhook
//     cannot carry. The webhook retires with the relay.
//   - decisionId idempotent redelivery moved HERE from the connector: an already-delivered
//     decisionId is re-acked WITHOUT re-posting (the delivered-store is the same SeenStore
//     pattern, keyed by decisionId — distinct from the qitemId outbound seen-state).
//   - delivered-ok additionally marks the qitemId seen (slice-11: seen ONLY after success) and
//     releases the driver's in-flight guard.
