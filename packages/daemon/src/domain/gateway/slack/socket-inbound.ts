// S10 — the Socket Mode INBOUND service, in-daemon. The loop is the shipped relay runner's
// (moved verbatim from the CLI `rig slack inbound` action, which retires with the cutover):
// open the ws via apps.connections.open, FAST-ACK every envelope, route human messages through
// the InboundRouter, drain the dead-letter on connect + periodically (B1), reconnect with
// backoff. Amendment A1 (M1 §3): inbound rides the PLATFORM socket — this service — never a
// gateway↔connector wire.
//
// Cold-init receipts (dual-path class "inbound cold-init"): on every (re)connect the router's
// dead-letter set drains before new traffic matters, and a fresh boot picks up where the
// durable seen/dead-letter stores left off — no replay storm, no drop.
//
// Liveness: an open socket is not proof that Slack delivers events to it. A connection on Build
// stayed "connected" for an hour while Slack delivered nothing, and two button presses were
// lost. Two signals catch that, each armed only once this connection has shown it: server pings
// (what Slack's own Node client watches; undici publishes each one on diagnostics_channel), and
// the echo of our own posts, which comes back as an event on a healthy connection. A failed
// signal replaces the connection: a new one opens first, then the old one goes.
