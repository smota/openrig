/**
 * Slice 27 — Claude auto-compaction policy enforcer.
 *
 * Decides per-seat whether ContextMonitor should send `/compact` based on
 * operator-configured policy (`policies.claude_compaction.*` settings).
 * Decoupled from ContextMonitor's scheduling concern so it can be tested
 * + composed independently.
 *
 * Risk class: compaction lifecycle is load-bearing (banked permission-layer
 * foot-gun rule extends to any agent-runtime trigger). Defensive contract:
 *
 * - Opt-in default-off: `enabled=false` → never triggers. Verified by
 *   regression test HG-5.
 * - Runtime filter: triggers only when runtime === "claude-code". Codex
 *   compacts cleanly via its own runtime per agent-startup-guide; other
 *   runtimes are out of scope.
 * - Re-arm: after a successful pre-compaction prep + /compact send, the
 *   session must drop below threshold before another auto-compact can
 *   fire. The dedup window still blocks immediate flaps; the threshold
 *   crossing rule prevents one high-usage session from receiving
 *   /compact every 60s. State is intentionally NOT persisted; daemon
 *   restart resets the window which is the safer-failure direction
 *   (might re-compact once on restart in rare cases, won't lock out
 *   forever).
 * - Definite pre-write prep failures retry at most three times. Uncertain
 *   delivery never replays. Unfinished preparation stops visibly until an
 *   explicit retry; it cannot arm a delayed compact after its deadline.
 * - Pre-compact prep: the first threshold crossing sends a normal
 *   user-channel prompt asking Claude to load the restore skill and
 *   write an attempt-bound restore map. Existing polls send /compact only after
 *   atomic publication of that completed artifact, within the preparation deadline.
 * - Post-compact restore: after a successful auto-compact, the enforcer
 *   first sends a turn-boundary handshake once context usage drops below
 *   threshold, or when the latest sample is stale or unknown (a seat that
 *   takes no turn after /compact never refreshes its sample), then sends the
 *   restore prompt on a later polling tick.
 *   This is intentionally active because Claude hooks can provide
 *   context, but they do not create a new assistant turn by themselves.
