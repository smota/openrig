# OpenRig Instance Layout

An OpenRig instance keeps its managed state under one configured
`$OPENRIG_HOME`. `rig daemon start` and direct daemon first start reconcile the
same additive layout before the database is opened or the listener binds.

```text

  config.json             # typed instance settings; created as an empty object
  state/                  # runtime-owned durable state

```

The initializer creates only missing managed entries. It never overwrites an
existing file, and it checks every managed path before the first write. A path
with the wrong type is reported by its exact location; unrelated user-owned
content is preserved. A second run against an already-converged instance writes
nothing.

The workspace subtree is owned by the [Project Workspace
Contract](project-workspace.md). The instance initializer calls that owner
rather than carrying another copy of its file bytes. `skills/` and `topology/`
are created as empty roots; their respective catalog and topology workflows own
their contents.

## Context library setting

The addressable context library has one typed setting and one environment
override:

| Surface | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Config key | `context.root` |
| Environment | `OPENRIG_CONTEXT_ROOT` |
| Default | `$OPENRIG_HOME/context` |
| Resolved property | `contextRoot` |

The removed `context.packs_root`, `context.packsRoot`, and
`OPENRIG_CONTEXT_PACKS_ROOT` spellings are refused with guidance to use
`context.root`; they are not compatibility aliases. Bundle installation and
`rig context add` both resolve the same configured landing root.

## System World

The System World is the instance-wide baseline selected before topology/role
and Project World material. Its versioned manifest contains ordered context-pack
references plus managed skill identities; it never contains authoritative skill
bytes. The default manifest is installed additively at
`$OPENRIG_HOME/context/system/system-world.yaml`.

| Surface | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Config key | `context.system_world` |
| Environment | `OPENRIG_CONTEXT_SYSTEM_WORLD` |
| Default | `default` |
| Resolved property | `systemWorld` |

`default` selects the installed manifest, a safe relative or absolute path
selects an explicit replacement, and `disabled` is an explicit off state.
Missing or malformed selections fail; absence is never inferred as disablement.
`rig context work-install --json` reports the effective state, source, manifest,
context selectors, and skills. With `--runtime`, its managed skill loadout then
combines System World, topology, and Project World selectors with provenance.
The catalog is a Git checkout. A skill folder with uncommitted or untracked content is
skipped by itself and named. With `--runtime`, work-install reports selected skips with
exit 1. It inspects by default; `--apply-skills` projects the remaining clean skills while
keeping any previously projected copy of the skipped skill. An uncommitted change directly
in the catalog root, such as `catalog.yaml`, still makes the whole catalog unavailable.

For a pre-0.5.9 home, use the `openrig-upgrade` skill's
`migrate-telemetry-state-0.5.9.mjs` helper as an Agent-Operated Migration. Its
order is plan → `--apply-state` → separately activate the target runtime →
paired new-root samples newer than any bounded legacy tail → `--verify` → the
non-destructive finalizer `--apply-library`. During activation, runtime readers
are canonical-first with legacy-fallback and a custom context-library root
remains stable. Verification binds exact accepted tail bytes; finalization
revalidates them, copies without overwrite, and switches config last. It never
removes the legacy telemetry or library. `--rollback` reverses only helper-owned
config, System World, empty-directory, and copied-library effects. The helper
must stop rather than claim success if writer/reader convergence, resumed legacy
writes, byte drift, collision, or any migration-owned path cannot be proved.
`--help` prints the phase grammar without inventorying; no phase flag is the
intentional read-only plan, and unknown options fail nonzero before plan or
mutation.

## Existing spec libraries

Creating `$OPENRIG_HOME/specs` does not migrate existing launch-era specs.
Upgraded installations may still have a separate legacy specs library that the
runtime reads for compatibility. Treat the two-home state as an explicit
limitation: use the live spec-library commands to determine where a spec is
served from, and do not infer convergence merely because the canonical
directory exists.

Config updates publish a complete replacement file atomically where directory
permissions and the filesystem allow it. On POSIX systems, replacement preserves
the existing owner, group, and read/write/execute permission bits. If creating or
preparing the replacement, or renaming it, fails with `EACCES`, `EPERM`, or `EBUSY`,
the stores write the writable target in place, preserving compatibility with
unwritable directories and single-file bind mounts. This fallback is not atomic
and retains the previous partial-write risk. Read-only config files are refused.
Other errors, including `ENOSPC`, leave the original file intact on the atomic
path. Atomic replacement does not carry extended ACLs or other inode metadata;
a hard-linked second name continues to refer to the previous file.
