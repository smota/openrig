# Workflow Runtime — Specs, Packets, and Lifecycle Graphs

Source snapshot: `e8f0ab340db773392ec8be75b072d1c0f3068a50`. This describes the source at that commit;
it does not establish the version or behavior of a running daemon.

A workflow binds a specification to durable queue packets. The daemon
records the instance, its current frontier, and the step trail; agents supply
step outcomes and evidence. Serial workflows and dependency graphs share
this runtime. The engine checks declared fields and recorded state; it does
not judge the substance of a referenced proof document.

## Specification and cache

`parseWorkflowSpec` parses the `workflow` document and checks known key sets.
`WorkflowValidator.validate` then checks relationships between roles, steps,
exits, and targets. The exits are `handoff`, `waiting`, `done`, and `failed`.
An exit-specific `next_hop.on` mapping takes precedence over structural
routing; without a mapping, `resolveNextStep` considers `forbid`, suggested
roles, `require`, and then the next array element.

The language includes `harness`, `host`, singular `gate`, `depends_on`, typed
`acceptance`, and waiting re-presentation settings. At this pin,
`WORKFLOW_AGENT_HARNESSES` contains only `claude-code` and `codex`; support for
another runtime elsewhere in OpenRig does not add it to this pin's workflow
harness grammar. Nonlocal host pins can validate as registered names but
`instantiate` still rejects execution with `host_pin_remote_unsupported`.
This is a workflow-step restriction, not a claim that all queue traffic is
local-only.

A step whose `allowed_exits` can neither finish it nor route it on is refused as
`step_cannot_finish` (`workflow-validator.ts:223-236`): its exits leave out `done`, none is
mapped in `next_hop.on`, and it allows no `handoff` that routes on. In a dependency graph,
allowing `handoff` is enough, because handoff completes a sink. `instantiate` refuses any spec
with a validation error.

`allowed_exits` and `max_hops` affect validation/projection. In contrast,
`continuation_required`, `preserve_lineage`, `closure_required`, closure
messages, `skill_refs`, and `spawn_budget` produce
`declared_not_enforced_v1` advisories. Legacy `gates: []` and
`next_hop.mode: prefer` are rejected by the parser rather than silently
accepted. Prerequisite cycles are rejected; a routing cycle requires a
`max_hops` declaration and is distinct from a prerequisite cycle.
`re_present_after_seconds` compiles to the queue's park timer on an unrouted
`waiting` exit, and `re_present_max_seconds` turns it into a repeating
reminder with backoff (`workflow-projector.ts:534`–`549`); a step that cannot
reach `waiting`, or that maps `waiting` to a branch, fails validation
(`waiting_re_presentation_unreachable`).

`WorkflowSpecCache.readThrough` parses the source file, hashes it, and
updates the `(name, version)` cache row. Full `spec_json` preserves fields
that the older scalar columns cannot represent. A same-name/same-version
source edit can update that cache row; the version label alone is not an
immutable content pin. `getByNameVersion` is the runtime lookup.
Diagnostic-only rows, moved sources, and versions retained for unfinished
work have separate paths in `readThrough`, `writeDiagnostic`, and
`isPinnedByUnfinishedWork`.

## Durable state

The migration files record the storage evolution; they are not a count of
all database migrations:

| Migration | Workflow state introduced |
|---|---|
| [`033`](../../../packages/daemon/src/db/migrations/033_workflow_specs.ts), [`034`](../../../packages/daemon/src/db/migrations/034_workflow_instances.ts), [`035`](../../../packages/daemon/src/db/migrations/035_workflow_step_trails.ts) | Spec cache, instances/frontier/current step, and append-only trail API. |
| [`040`](../../../packages/daemon/src/db/migrations/040_workflow_specs_diagnostic.ts), [`050`](../../../packages/daemon/src/db/migrations/050_workflow_spec_json.ts) | Cache diagnostics and complete parsed spec JSON. |
| [`049`](../../../packages/daemon/src/db/migrations/049_workflow_instance_version.ts), [`051`](../../../packages/daemon/src/db/migrations/051_workflow_resume.ts), [`052`](../../../packages/daemon/src/db/migrations/052_workflow_instance_bound_rig.ts) | Optimistic version guard, resume/hop baseline, and bound rig. |
| [`079`](../../../packages/daemon/src/db/migrations/079_workflow_lifecycle_parallel.ts) | Lifecycle operation key/digest/binding, packet-to-step frontier bindings, and failure occurrences. |

Current instance states include `active`, `waiting`, `completed`, `failed`,
and `aborted`. A multi-packet frontier needs packet-to-step bindings; a
single `current_step_id` cannot describe all parallel work.

## Instantiation and owner selection

`WorkflowRuntime.instantiate` resolves a cached spec name or explicit path,
validates it, resolves the rig and the entry owner, then creates the instance
and its single entry packet (for `steps[0]`) through the transactional
event/queue path (`workflow-runtime.ts:433`, `:757`). The entry packet gets a
best-effort post-commit nudge with no staged wake intent (`:843`–`845`); its
keepalive, armed in the same transaction, and the boot sweep cover a lost
entry nudge. An explicit
unknown `targetRig` fails; an unknown spec-default rig produces an advisory
and falls back to unbound operation. A bound rig without a required declared
role is a different error.

`resolveDefaultOwner` uses declared `preferred_targets` first, applying a
harness match when pinned. With no preferred targets and a bound rig, it uses
[`selectRoleSeat`](../../../packages/daemon/src/domain/workflow-role-resolver.ts):
a running managed agent with the declared role and required runtime, ordered
by pending-only backlog and then canonical coordinate. Infrastructure and
unresolvable/adopted coordinates do not become implicit replacement agents.
Explicit owner overrides are reconciled with harness pins. Declared
`preferred_targets` are not checked for liveness; validate and instantiate
only warn (`role_no_live_preferred_target`) when none of a role's targets has
a running session. A structured gate compiles by target kind (`compileGate`):
for a human-seat target, the packet goes to the gated step's own owner and is
parked `blocked_on` that human seat in the same transaction (summary and
`evidence_ref` required), and the instance waits until the park is resolved;
for a declared role, an ordinary packet goes to that handler role's seat
(`workflow-projector.ts:1659`–`1778`).

Instantiation also emits advisories for missing members in otherwise
registered target rigs. That member check is advisory and does not imply
all preferred targets received a live-readiness test.

## Projection, waiting, and concurrency

`WorkflowProjector.project` checks active/waiting status, frontier membership,
packet-to-step identity, allowed exits, and applicable evidence requirements.
For a successful advance, queue closure, successor creation, trail entries,
frontier/version updates, durable events, and wake intent staging share the
transactional notification envelope. Terminal delivery happens after the
commit, and the runtime awaits it, so project, route, resume and exception
responses return after the delivery attempt; a terminal close without its
successor's staged intent rolls back. A committed packet or staged wake is
not evidence that its recipient consumed the message.

Each exit closes the packet through the queue's own closure path
(`updateWithinTransaction`, hot-potato rules intact): `handoff` records
`handed-off` with `handed_off_to` the next owner; `waiting` records `blocked`
with `blocked_on` the supplied blocker, or `external-gate` when none is given;
`done` records `done` with `no-follow-on`; and `failed` records `done` with
`denied` and the result note as target (`workflow-projector.ts:1571`–`1631`).
A dependency-graph handoff that fans out to more than one successor, or to
none, closes the packet `done` with `no-follow-on`.

Both executors absorb an identical waiting replay by matching the stored
closure intent; changed wait data is a new decision. A consumed terminal
packet is no longer on the frontier and is refused. On the serial path a
routed close moves the frontier to the new packet and leaves the instance
`active`, or `waiting` when the target step is gated; an unrouted `waiting`
keeps the closed packet on the frontier so the keepalive can find its owner;
`failed` sets `failed`, and `done` with nothing left sets `completed`. A
dependency graph is `waiting` while every frontier packet is blocked, and
`failed` when the frontier empties with an unresolved occurrence.
`max_hops` constrains routing relative to the current drive's baseline: a
route that would exceed it becomes a `failed` exit with a `max_hops_exceeded`
note and evidence, the packet closes and no successor is created
(`workflow-projector.ts:419`–`443`); resume establishes a new bounded drive
rather than erasing history.

Presence of `depends_on` selects `projectDependencyGraph`. It uses durable
packet bindings to advance eligible successors and record per-occurrence
failures without treating an unrelated live branch as completed. A step's
completion counts only while it is later, in trail append order, than its
prerequisites' latest completions, so a prerequisite re-run through a routed
exit sends its dependents round again (`workflow-projector.ts:1004`–`1019`).
Inspection reports unknown bindings rather than inventing a step from trail order.

The injected [`createWorkflowFrontierPredicate`](../../../packages/daemon/src/domain/workflow-frontier-guard.ts)
lets the queue refuse ordinary terminal closure of live workflow packets.
Workflow mutations use the explicit workflow path; the queue does not need
to import the workflow domain to evaluate that predicate.

## Recovery operations

`WorkflowRuntime` distinguishes these operations:

| Operation | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `route` | Replace a current packet's owner while retaining the step. This is not step advancement. Multiple frontier packets require an explicit packet selection. |
| `resume` | Redrive failed work to a newly resolved owner, recording the optional `--decision` text. A serial instance must be `failed` (`instance_not_failed`). Resume re-resolves the owner rather than copying it, re-bases `hops_baseline`, increments `resume_count`, and closes that occurrence's open exception items. Dependency failures use occurrence identity; multiple unresolved failures require selection. Identical occurrence/decision replay returns the recorded redrive, while changed decision bytes conflict. |
| `abort` | Explicitly stop unfinished work with an actor and reason: cancels every frontier packet, records a `failed` trail row per packet, sets `aborted`, and emits `workflow.failed` with reason `aborted: <reason>`. Refused only for `completed` or `aborted` instances. |
| `continue` | Read-only inspection of instance, trail, guidance, reconciliation, frontier, failures, unknowns, and boundary obligations. It does not mechanically advance a step. |

## Deadlines and exceptions

[`evaluateStepDeadline`](../../../packages/daemon/src/domain/workflow-deadline.ts)
derives overdue state from frontier queue rows. Claimed work uses its closure
deadline, otherwise its claim time plus **4 hours** (creation time if the
claim time is absent). Pending work uses creation time plus **4 hours**.
Blocked waits are not overdue under this evaluator. This is a diagnostic,
not a substitute for packet existence or binding checks.

Instantiate and every routed projection arm a `workflow-keepalive` watchdog
job in the same transaction (one per live packet for dependency graphs, one
per instance for serial specs), evaluated every 15 minutes and quiet until the
step is overdue (`workflow-keepalive-arming.ts:38`). At each daemon start the
boot sweep re-arms keepalives for live instances, re-nudges pending frontier
packets that were never nudged, and surfaces overdue instances
(`workflow-boot-sweep.ts`). Neither path advances a step.

There are three exception classes: `unmapped_failed`, `stuck_overdue` and
`human_gate_trip` (`workflow-exception.ts:34`–`38`). An unrouted `failed`
exit creates one urgent `workflow-exception` queue item in the same
transaction, with evidence `rig workflow trace <instance>` and a body naming
the `rig workflow resume` command; a human gate's own parked packet carries the
`human_gate_trip` identity, so no second item is created.

[`resolveExceptionRoute`](../../../packages/daemon/src/domain/workflow-exception-router.ts)
selects per-class configuration, then workflow default, host default, and
finally orchestrator-first behavior. An unresolved orchestrator route falls
back to registered-human selection. A human gate is intrinsically human
routed. Agent-routed exceptions use the ordinary workflow tier; human-routed
ones use `human-gate`.

[`workflow-human-destination.ts`](../../../packages/daemon/src/domain/workflow-human-destination.ts)
handles human selection: the registered human named by
`workspace.operator_seat_name`, or the only registered human when it is unset;
any other case fails with `workflow_human_destination_unavailable` (409). The
host default dial is the setting `workflow.exception_routing`
(`orchestrator` or `human_only`), read per exception. A valid agent route need
not have a human fallback configured. If fallback is needed, missing/ambiguous selection is an explicit
error, not an invented destination. Failure admission is transactional;
overdue detection is handled by boot/keepalive paths. Runtime reconciliation
closes recovered overdue occurrences against their own packets, preserving
unresolved siblings and unknown provenance.

## Project lifecycle graphs

`compileLifecycle` delegates to
[`compileProjectLifecycle`](../../../packages/daemon/src/domain/project-lifecycle-compiler.ts).
`instantiateLifecycle` requires an operation key and compiled input digest.
An exact replay retrieves the recorded instance/entry packet; changed input
under the same key conflicts. Compilation and an eligible result do not by
themselves launch work.

`inspectGraph`, `reviseGraph`, and `recoverGraphOperation` in
[`workflow-reconciliation.ts`](../../../packages/daemon/src/domain/workflow-reconciliation.ts)
separate inspection from explicit graph revision and operation recovery.
Inspection reports `current`, `source-only`, `compatible`, `incompatible`,
`unavailable` or `unbound`. Only a live, manifest-bound instance whose specs
are explicit dependency graphs without `next_hop.on` can be revised; a
revision may add steps and change unstarted ones, but may not remove steps,
touch a step with completed, live or failed work, drop a required obligation
or its order, change workflow-wide fields other than `exception_routing`, or
add an unstarted step with no outstanding prerequisite. A changed
`exception_routing` applies to future occurrences only; existing obligations
keep their owners. Applying needs the inspected version and digest, an
operation key, an actor and a reason; the receipt is kept in the instance's
`revisionHistory`, and replaying the same key with a different decision is
refused with `lifecycle_revision_conflict` (`workflow-reconciliation.ts:12`,
`:113`–`223`).
`guidance` reads context and current packet information without interpreting
an agent's substantive judgment.

For lifecycle steps that require a receipt, a `done`/`handoff` projection
requires an `evidence_ref`. Typed acceptance gates additionally compare the
submitted candidate, allowed verdict, and evidence reference against the
step declaration. These are mechanical identity/presence checks; the
projector does not read the referenced prose to decide whether the work is
good or ready to publish.

## CLI and HTTP surface

The [CLI inventory](../cli-reference.md#workflow) lists every registered
`rig workflow` subcommand and option. The implementation is
[`packages/cli/src/commands/workflow.ts`](../../../packages/cli/src/commands/workflow.ts).
The [`workflow` routes](../../../packages/daemon/src/routes/workflow.ts)
are mounted under `/api/workflow`:

| Method | Suffixes |
|---|---|
| `POST` | `/validate`, `/compile`, `/instantiate`, `/instantiate-lifecycle`, `/project` |
| `GET` | `/list`, `/specs`, `/operations/:key`, `/:instance_id`, `/:instance_id/trace`, `/:instance_id/guidance`, `/:instance_id/revision` |
| `POST` | `/:instance_id/route`, `/:instance_id/resume`, `/:instance_id/abort`, `/:instance_id/continue`, `/:instance_id/revision` |
| `GET` | `/sse`, `/watch` (same live event stream handler) |

The stream carries the 8 `workflow.*` events (`instantiated`, `step_closed`,
`next_qitem_projected`, `completed`, `failed`, `resumed`,
`routing_table_changed`, `revised`); it is not a general queue stream or a
stored-history replay. Route error mapping distinguishes missing
records, authoring errors, state/version conflicts, and internal failures.
See the source mapping before assigning a meaning to a nonzero CLI result.
