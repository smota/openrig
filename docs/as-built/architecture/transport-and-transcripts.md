# Transport, Transcripts, Chat, Ask

The communication-and-history layer: tmux is transport, not truth. Send/
capture/broadcast wrap tmux with honest errors; transcripts are bounded
`tmux capture-pane` snapshots written to files; chat is daemon-backed SQLite;
the daemon's `rig ask` service gathers evidence and never calls an LLM.

## 1. The naming axes (read this first)

Two independent naming axes meet in this layer. They must not be conflated or
blanket-replaced: `rigged` → `rig` is a per-occurrence question, not a global
substitution.

**Axis 1 — MCP tool names are `rig_*`.** `packages/cli/src/mcp-server.ts`
registers **18** tools, all named `rig_*`
(`grep -c 'server.tool(' packages/cli/src/mcp-server.ts`), including
`rig_rig_nodes` (`mcp-server.ts:288`), `rig_send` (`:305`),
`rig_capture` (`:339`), `rig_chatroom_send` (`:364`) and `rig_chatroom_watch`
(`:400`). No `rigged_*` name other than the tmux keys below remains in product
source: **0** hits
(`git grep -n 'rigged_' -- ':(glob)packages/*/src/**' | grep -v -c '@rigged_'`).

**Axis 2 — tmux metadata keys are `@rigged_*`, and are correct as-is.** The
tmux metadata keys written at claim/bind time are a separate thing from MCP
tool names and were not renamed. `setRiggedMetadata` in
`packages/daemon/src/domain/claim-service.ts:182`–`186` writes exactly **5**
keys (`grep -c '@rigged_' packages/daemon/src/domain/claim-service.ts`):
`@rigged_node_id`, `@rigged_session_name`, `@rigged_rig_id`,
`@rigged_rig_name`, `@rigged_logical_id`. Do not blanket-sed `rigged` → `rig`.
The metadata-key axis is detailed in `agent-spec-and-startup.md` (identity:
whoami, bind, adopt).

## 2. Transport and communication domain services

All under `packages/daemon/src/domain/`:

- `session-transport.ts` — communication primitives: send/capture/broadcast
  with session resolution, send-readiness classification (interactive-prompt
  and mid-work detection), honest error reporting, and list/pod/rig/global
  targeting.
- `transcript-store.ts` — transcript file management: path convention, ANSI
  stripping for tail and grep reads, boundary markers, `readTail`, `readFull`, `grep`.
  Filesystem-backed, NOT SQLite. The capture that writes the files is
  `transcript-rotation.ts` (§4).
- `history-query.ts` — transcript + chat search. Prefers `rg`, falls back to
  `grep -E`, surfaces which backend was used: `history-query.ts:8`
  `backend: "rg" | "grep" | "none"`; `:252` runs
  `rg -i --no-filename -e <pattern>` over the rig's transcript directory;
  `:267` falls back to `grep -E -i -h -e <pattern>`.
- `ask-service.ts` — context-engineering evidence pack: gathers rig summary
  plus transcript excerpts, chat excerpts, insufficiency state, guidance.
  Does NOT call an external LLM.
- `chat-repository.ts` — durable rig-scoped chat over the `chat_messages`
  table (`send`, `sendTopic`, `history`, `latest`, `searchChat`, `clear`). The
  repository emits no events: `routes/chat.ts` emits `chat.message` on the
  event bus after each send or topic, and `/watch` streams those as SSE.

Routes: `packages/daemon/src/routes/{transport,transcripts,ask,chat,whoami}.ts`
— all present.

## 3. Communication flow

`rig send <session> "message"` → CLI → `POST /api/transport/send` →
`SessionTransport.send()`:

1. Resolve the session name (`resolveBySessionName`,
   `session-transport.ts:963`): not found → 404; the same name in more than
   one rig → 409. A tmux probe of the session can also refuse it as missing or
   tmux as unavailable (`:1317`–`1334`). Pod, rig, global and `--to` list
   targets go through `POST /api/transport/broadcast`, which resolves them
   with `resolveSessions` and sends to each recipient in turn.
2. Take the seat's delivery lease. Every write runs under a per-seat,
   serialized lease from the seat delivery guard, installed at daemon start
   (`send`, `:1155`). With the seat's typing guard on, the message is held
   instead of typed: the result is `outcome: "retained"` with HTTP 200
   (`routes/transport.ts:115`); operators use `rig seat set-typing-guard` and
   `rig seat held-messages`.
3. Classify send readiness. Only a positive interactive-prompt reading
   (`needs_input`) refuses, with `target_needs_input`
   (`session-transport.ts:1482`), unless the caller passes
   `--dangerously-interact --reason`; that override persists an audit record
   before sending and refuses the send if it can't
   (`prompt_override_audit_unavailable`, `:1471`). A pane that reads `unknown` while the seat's
   latest runtime hook says it waits on a person reads as `needs_input` (`session-transport.ts:1878–1889`). A mid-work reading (`running`, from a
   fresh runtime hook or the pane's mid-work patterns,
   `findPatternEvidence(recentLines, [...MID_WORK_PATTERNS, CLAUDE_LIVE_STATUS_PATTERN])`,
   `:311–315`) or an `unknown` one proceeds with an advisory `warning` (`:1495`,
   `:1503`). `--force` has no effect on this path, and combining it with
   `--wait-for-idle` is refused with 400 (`routes/transport.ts:66`–`73`).
4. Two-step tmux send: a unique file/buffer pasted with `paste-buffer -d -r -p`
   (`packages/daemon/src/adapters/tmux.ts:625`) → ~200ms delay
   (`session-transport.ts:1558`) → separate named `Enter` (`session-transport.ts:1573–1578`). The paste
   targets the seat's registered pane ID, not the session name, and is refused
   with no input written if the session no longer holds exactly that pane.
   Bracketed paste preserves multiline input in supporting TUIs; the payload
   never enters a shell argument. A `--dangerously-interact` answer is pasted
   without `-p` (`session-transport.ts:1541`) and Enter is pressed only if the
   whole answer is still staged (`:1562`–`1570`). A successful paste proves
   transport execution, not runtime consumption.
5. Optional `--verify`: capture the last 30 pane lines before and after the
   send (after a 500 ms wait, `:1597`) and count the message's first 40
   characters in each. A higher count after the send reports
   `outcome: "delivered"`; otherwise the outcome is `rendered-unconfirmed` —
   text and Enter landed but the capture could not re-confirm the render,
   which is not a failure at the daemon (`session-transport.ts:700`
   `verify?`; `:1596` `if (opts?.verify)`; `:1608`
   `verified = postCount > preCount`). The outcome values are `delivered`,
   `rendered-unconfirmed`, `failed` and `retained` (`:772`).
6. CLI `--verify` goes further (`packages/cli/src/commands/send.ts:596`): it
   looks for the text still unsubmitted at the prompt, makes one guarded
   Enter-only retry through the daemon's `submitOnly` path
   (`session-transport.ts:1344`, which refuses with `staged_mismatch` unless the
   pane shows the expected staged text), and ends `staged-not-consumed` with
   exit code 1 if it is still there.
7. Honest result with reason on failure. Reasons missing from the send
   route's status map (among them the runtime-identity refusals) are returned
   with HTTP 500 (`routes/transport.ts:118`–`140`).

The sender comes from the `X-OpenRig-Session` header; an unsigned send gets an
unknown-sender notice. The CLI adds a From/To envelope, and the daemon appends
a delivered-latency note for delays of 10 s or more.

Architecture rule 18 (`architecture-rules-and-event-system.md`): tmux is
transport, not truth — `send/capture/broadcast` wrap tmux reliably with honest
errors.

### 3b. Cross-host coordination verbs

`rig send/capture/transcript/broadcast --host <id>` (and the `agent@rig@host`
target sugar on the session-target verbs) cross the host boundary through the
remote daemon's ordinary local routes; the cross-host logic is in the CLI.

- **Sidedness and caller pick the seam.** One-sided remote operations from a
  caller that can resolve the registry bearer locally (the CLI) go
  **CLI-direct** through `runRemoteHttpOp`
  (`packages/cli/src/remote-host-ops.ts:25`) — one hop, no local-daemon
  involvement, as `rig ps --all-hosts` does. Two-sided operations (a
  cross-host queue handoff closes the local source and creates the remote
  successor, so the local daemon owns half the transaction) and callers
  without the bearer (the browser: Mission Control actions and the `?host=`
  read-through) go through the local daemon, which forwards to the remote.
  These four verbs are one-sided remote operations from the CLI.
- **The host entry dictates the transport (ssh or http), never a per-call
  choice.** ssh hosts shell out over ssh for send/capture
  (`packages/cli/src/cross-host-executor.ts`); http hosts (the kind
  `rig host pair` registers) go CLI-direct to
  `POST /api/transport/send|capture|broadcast` / `GET /api/transcripts/*` with
  the same bodies and paths the local CLI uses. transcript and broadcast are
  http-only (no ssh path exists for them); on an ssh host they fail with a
  structured error naming the transport requirement
  (`remote-host-ops.ts:47`), never a fallback.
- **Terminal-bearer posture (`/api/transport/*` only).** The remote's
  transport routes (send/capture/broadcast) gate on its terminal bearer
  (`routes/transport.ts:26`; `OPENRIG_TERMINAL_BEARER_TOKEN`,
  `packages/daemon/src/index.ts:291`). With no token configured the
  middleware passes every request through
  (`packages/daemon/src/middleware/auth-bearer-token.ts:99`) — the tailnet is
  the auth boundary by design — except that a daemon bound to an explicit
  address that is neither local nor tailnet falls back to
  `OPENRIG_AUTH_BEARER_TOKEN`
  (`index.ts:297`). The CLI presents the registry bearer from `hosts.yaml`
  when one is configured; for a URL-only anonymous host the `Authorization`
  header is omitted. A remote enforcing a different terminal bearer answers
  401, which surfaces as the structured `permission-gate` step
  (`packages/cli/src/host-registry.ts:53`) — never a hang, never silent.
  Remedy: set the remote terminal bearer equal to the paired registry bearer,
  or rely on the tailnet boundary. **The transcript read is deliberately
  outside this class:** `/api/transcripts/*` mounts with no bearer middleware
  (`packages/daemon/src/server.ts:748`, beside the gated `/api/transport` at
  `:749`), and credential-shaped text is redacted on the `/full` route only
  (`routes/transcripts.ts:292`). So a wrong terminal bearer that
  permission-gates `send --host` does NOT gate `transcript --host` — the read
  keeps succeeding for a Host name the remote's browser boundary accepts
  (`server.ts:647`; it applies to every `/api/*` route), and the auth-failure
  class is not uniform across the four verbs. The route's own comment (`routes/transcripts.ts:250`) leaves a
  coherent transcript-read auth policy across tail/grep/full for later.
- **The 3-part form is CLI-edge sugar only.** `resolveCrossHostTarget`
  (`packages/cli/src/cross-host-target.ts:58`) strips the suffix only when it
  resolves to a registered host, or equals this host's own id, which routes
  home (`:95`; only `rig send` passes the self id,
  `packages/cli/src/commands/send.ts:398`, so `capture` and `transcript` treat
  their own id as unknown); otherwise the string passes through unchanged with a loud
  host hint. Every session string that reaches any daemon stays
  `member@rig`; the host travels out-of-band. Durable cross-host
  coordination stays the queue's cross-host routing
  (`coordination-primitive.md`); these four verbs add no queue surface.

## 4. Transcript flow

1. `NodeLauncher` starts transcript rotation right after tmux session
   creation, before the harness boots
   (`packages/daemon/src/domain/node-launcher.ts:181`).
2. Each rotation tick captures the trailing lines with
   `capturePaneContent` (`transcript-rotation.ts:213` →
   `adapters/tmux.ts:1082`) and atomically overwrites (temp file + rename,
   `transcript-rotation.ts:283`–`285`)
   `transcripts/{rig-name}/{session-name}.log` under the OpenRig home (or
   the `transcripts.path` setting). It skips the write when the captured bytes
   are unchanged. Defaults: 1000 trailing lines every 2 s
   (`transcript-rotation.ts:27`–`28`); an idle seat is captured less often,
   within the 10-second freshness window. Both are tunable with
   `OPENRIG_TRANSCRIPTS_LINES` and `OPENRIG_TRANSCRIPTS_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`
   or the matching `transcripts.*` settings. This bounded capture replaced the
   earlier `tmux pipe-pane` stream (`transcript-rotation.ts:3`), so the file
   holds a trailing window, not the whole session.
3. `TranscriptStore` owns path convention, ANSI stripping for `readTail` and
   `grep`, boundary
   markers, `readTail`, `readFull`, `grep`. `readFull` returns the raw bytes
   (`transcript-store.ts:378`); the `/full` route redacts them. The transcript
   routes check capture health first and can start capture lazily for a seat
   that has none.
4. `rig transcript <session> --tail N / --grep "pattern"` provides
   agent-facing access.
5. On restore: a `--- SESSION BOUNDARY: … ---` marker is written before
   re-launch (`restore-orchestrator.ts:900`); each rotation tick keeps each
   distinct boundary line once, as a header above the fresh capture
   (`transcript-rotation.ts:254`–`257`). (Restore-side detail in
   `lifecycle-snapshot-restore.md`.)
6. `rig ask` gathers rig summary plus transcript excerpts, chat excerpts,
   insufficiency state, and guidance.

Architecture rule 19, as the code implements it: transcripts are a bounded
`capture-pane` snapshot (not pipe-pane), ANSI-stripped on tail and grep reads; `rg`
preferred, `grep -E` fallback. Rule 22: the daemon's `rig ask` is context
engineering — it gathers evidence and does NOT call an external LLM; the
agent IS the LLM. The one exception is the explicit CLI flag `rig ask --wake`
(`packages/cli/src/commands/ask.ts:88`), which runs a headless resume of a
Claude or Codex session (`claude -p --resume` / `codex exec resume`,
`packages/cli/src/ask-wake.ts:58`–`60`) to answer one question.

## 5. Chat flow

1. `rig chatroom send <rig> "message"` → `POST
   /api/rigs/:rigId/chat/send` → `ChatRepository.send()`
   (`routes/chat.ts:43`); the route then emits `chat.message` (`:45`).
2. SSE: `GET /api/rigs/:rigId/chat/watch` delivers real-time messages.
3. History: `GET /api/rigs/:rigId/chat/history` returns channel history in id
   order, 100 messages unless `limit` says otherwise
   (`chat-repository.ts:68`), filterable by `topic`, `after`, `since` and
   `sender` (a `since` SQLite cannot parse is refused with 400,
   `routes/chat.ts:73`); `POST /api/rigs/:rigId/chat/topic` persists topic markers.
4. UI: a `RigChatPanel` component exists
   (`packages/ui/src/components/RigChatPanel.tsx`), but no UI view mounts it:
   **1** file under `packages/ui/src` names it, its own
   (`git grep -l 'RigChatPanel' -- packages/ui/src | wc -l`).
5. MCP: **`rig_chatroom_send` + `rig_chatroom_watch`** (`mcp-server.ts:364`,
   `:400`).
6. Source of truth: daemon-backed SQLite (`chat_messages` table), NOT tmux
   scrollback.

**ChatMessage** type (`chat-repository.ts:6`): durable rig-scoped message —
`id`, `rigId`, `sender`, `kind`, `body`, `topic`, `createdAt`.

## 6. Compatibility notes

The intentional limits in this layer (numbered as in
`architecture-rules-and-event-system.md`):

- Note 4 — the daemon's `rig ask` gathers context only; it does not call an
  external LLM. The agent reasons about the gathered evidence. Only the
  explicit `--wake` flag executes a runtime (§4).
- Note 5 — transcript search prefers `rg` but falls back to `grep -E`;
  search quality/performance varies by backend.
- Note 6 — chat is rig-scoped only: no cross-rig channels or DMs.
- Note 7 — `--verify` on `rig send` checks the pane for the message by
  comparing snippet counts before and after the send (§3 step 4); when the
  capture cannot re-confirm the render it reports `rendered-unconfirmed`,
  not a failure.

(The full compatibility-notes list lives in
`architecture-rules-and-event-system.md`.)
